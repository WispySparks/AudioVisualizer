# AudioVisualizer

Project where I'm going to implement my own MP3 Decoder and so I will take in MP3 Files and decode/decompress them into PCM Samples which I can then grab the amplitude from using fourier stuff or something(?) and then use some sort of visual like a wave or graphic to visualize the music as it plays from the pcm sample's amplitude.
